# EDA_DonorsChoose
Data Analysis on DonorsChoose.org

## Description
This project is about the data analysis on datum from <a href="https://www.donorschoose.org/">DonorsChoose</a>, using IPython notebook.  

The first part is the exploratory data analysis. Here we check the robustness and consistency of the datum first, then do some basic summary statistics and visualizations.
Finally we try to explore information hidden in these datum.  

The second part is about time series analysis. First we visualize the time series, then apply ARIMA and LSTM models on these series, trying to explain the patterns.

## File Layouts
**EDA.ipynb**: IPython notebook for the project  

## Future
This project is under progressing. Exploratory data analysis section will be separated from time series analysis section, after the first section is completed.
Text analytics section will be added in the future.
